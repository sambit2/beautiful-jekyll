Saying it is very easy, but doing it for real is not that easy! Connecting to my rejection experiences in the first year, I made 3 conference submissions out of which 2 were rejected.

This doesn't help the scientific community of academicians and researchers who are toiling hard to make multiple submissions but somehow most are embarrassed to discuss about it. So, please watch my Vlog enclosed below to know more about how to tackle these positively. Here, I will list down some points in brief:
* All these rejections should be considered as a stepping stone for future conference or journal submissions. Once you produce some scientific works, then they can be reshaped and modified according to the requirements of the future submissions.
