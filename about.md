## Currently

My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sambitpraharaj/">Sambit Praharaj</a>. Now, I have started my new research adventure as a <b>PhD candidate</b> in the <b>Technology Enhanced Learning Innovations (TELI) </b> group at <a href="https://www.ou.nl/welten-instituut">Welten Institute</a> in <a href="https://www.ou.nl/">Open University</a> of Netherlands from 1st of September. I live in the beautiful city of <a href ="http://www.valkenburg.nl/">Valkenburg</a> sandwiched between Germany and Belgium in near proximity. My promotors are <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fC3dymIAAAAJ">Prof. dr. Marcus Specht </a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v1hwiRAAAAAJ">Prof. dr. Hendrik Drachsler</a>. Additionally, I have <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=iI8G4nYAAAAJ&hl=de">Dr. Maren Scheffel</a> as my supportive daily supervisor. My research primarily focuses on the use of Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) in a Co-located Collaboration (CC) scenario. Apart from diving deep into my PhD research, my other plans are to widen my knowledge and experience in Neural networks and Deep Learning by following other courses from Coursera and Udacity. I am also following other books and online resources to get hands-on experience in Scikit and Tensorflow. It can help me to strengthen my PhD research at later stages when I build the prediction models to support CC in real-time. My research interests revolve around Multimodal Learning, Technology Enhanced Learning, AI, Human Computer Interaction, Learning Analytics, Educational sciences and Psychological Behaviour.

## Previously

Previously, I was a <b>Master's student</b> in the <a href="http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/">Web Information Systems</a> group in <b>Computer Science</b> at <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft</a> collaborating with <a href="http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/lambda-lab/">Lambda Lab</a> and researchers from <a href="http://www.usi.ch/en">University of Lugano</a>, Switzerland. My advisors were Prof. <a href="http://www.alessandrobozzon.com/">Alessandro Bozzon</a> and Prof. <a href="http://chauff.github.io/">Claudia Hauff</a>. The platform which I was using for my <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ae55389c3-3966-40f5-bf83-a8f9c6c393f0">thesis</a> is <a href="http://asq.inf.usi.ch/">ASQ</a> whose founder <a href="http://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/triglianos/">Vasileios Triglianos</a>, currently a PhD student in the Faculty of Informatics at the University of Lugano was also assisting me in my thesis. I finished my thesis on <b>"Data Analytics in Web-based Education in the Higher-education Classroom"</b>. Main focus was on developing tools and methods in classroom analytics using web-based lecturing tools where I was responsible for preparing the <a href="https://github.com/sambit2/delft-web-technology-and-database-slides-2016-2017/">slides</a> which are to be used in the Bachelor's Course of <a href="http://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34554">Web and Database Technology</a> for the <b>session 2016-17</b> which was mostly designed in impress.js and some using reveal.js in ASQ. My other focus was to design a <b>traffic light</b> type <b>semaphore lamp</b> which can help in the <b>visualization of the attention states</b> of the whole classroom in <b>realtime</b> whose initial design is in this <a href="https://github.com/sambit2/DataAnalytics-Web-based-Education">repository</a>. This design was left in its premature stages due to time constraints during a Master's thesis. Afterwards, the data i.e. gathered as log files from all the lectures which is around 19 which includes 15 live lectures and 4 live labs that use ASQ for <b>live database query, quizzes and live nodejs implementation</b> was analyzed in this <a href="https://github.com/triglian/delft-web-and-database-technology-2016-asq-analysis">repository</a> from different perspectives to indicate the <b>attention level, reaction time, cognitive load, performance, attention variation, property of different group of students</b>, etc. which can improve the current state-of-the-art classroom teaching while lessening the burden of teachers as they can get some idea regarding the state of the classroom from these indicators to improve their courses next year and also may work on some kind of intervention as a future work.
