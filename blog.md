**[September 2018] EC-TEL 2018, Leeds UK**

It was the 8th of June when I was anxious to hear about the decision of the EC-TEL full research paper acceptance. Finally, all that waiting did not disappoint and soon the nervous energy turned into more of positivity and self-confidence. As a non-European, the first thing to worry now was to get a approved UK Visa! Although it was not much of a hassle, it was the intital road-block separating me from attending the first conference during my first year of my PhD.

After all the preparations, the day i.e., 2nd September arrived and I started my journey from Amsterdam to Leeds. Although I had a smooth experience with the flight, it soon turned into utter dismay when I was wandering through the campus of University of Leeds after getting down from the bus near WestGate. It took me quite a bit of time to reach my accommodation in Storm Jameson Court in the university campus. It could be attributed to my own fault of not taking a taxi directly to my accommodation and also the confusing nature of the signboards in the campus. Nevertheless, the locals were really helpful and would always hop in to make sure that I found my way!
